# Geostat note. About using minimum width for vein modelling.

Minimum width is a modelling parameter or constraint that is usually applied at the time of modelling narrow veins. The most common reason for imposing a minimum width is to ensure the average grade interpolated is similar to the grade of mining stopes. However, the same results are obtained by adding dilution. 

Let's review the example. Fig. 1. a) shows the interpolation in a narrow vein of constant thickness 1m and applying internal dilution, assuming the stopes will be 5m width and 20m high. Fig. 1. b) shows the same narrow vein interpolated after applying a minimum width.
The average grade of the vein plus the waste over 20 m is approximately 9.2 g/t in both cases. In the case of the the vein modelled with minimum width this is `(8m*0g/t + 1m*2g/t + 1m*90g/t)/10m = 9.2g/t`. The 1m vein itself (Fig. 1. a)) is (2 g/t + 90 g/t)/2= 46 g/t, but there are 4m of waste at zero grade added as dilution, so the average grade is `1m*46g/t + 4m*0g/t)/5m = 9.2g/t`.

In most cases, interpolating the narrow vein without minimum width is preferred, especially if the vein contacts are well defined by visual inspection, grade, or other criteria. And this is why:
 1) The vein and the waste represent different geostatistical distribution with higher grade continuity, different means, variances, and spatial continuity. Combining the two statistical populations will reduce the spatial continuity (for example, all waste sample composites are uncorrelated width vein sample composites). This will be reflected in variograms with very poor continuity. It will also make the mineralization appear higher nuggety and increase the coefficient of variation. Interpolations with linear techniques such as ordinary kriging and inverse of the power of the distance will be harder to apply. In addition, they will be sensitive to changes in interpolation parameters (mainly on min-max, the maximum number of samples per drillholes, and search ellipse dimensions). They will also suffer from severe over smoothing (underestimating high grades and overestimating low grades). 
 2) If the number of waste samples is large (like in fig 1), then the proportion of samples mineralized is low (low probability of higher grade samples). Therefore, many decisions based on sample distribution (histogram and CDF) will likely be wrong. For example, the 90 g/t composite will be considered an outlier and harshly capped. Likewise, techniques based on CDF, such as normal score transformation, normal score or lognormal variogram, global change of support, and conditional simulations, will be unreliable. 
 3) Modelling with minimum width will limit the ability of mining engineers to test different mining scenarios, for example, narrower stopes, preferential dilution to a specific side of the vein, or the implementation of more selective mining techniques (cut and fill by stages). 

These assumptions are also valid for other scenarios. It is always better to avoid mixing statistical populations (mainly incorporating too many extremely low-grade samples in mineralized domains) and incorporating mining constraints when modelling estimation domains.
